Welcome to our blog!  Our family has been through a lot recently, and we're going to use this as a place to be in public - share changes, improvements, problems, and everything in between.

It's a little strange being "online" but it's a fun forcing function to get us to write more, and writing is a good way to reflect on everything that's been going on with us
